			<div class="par-case">Growing up in Maine focusing on tennis as a sport is a challenge.
				Cost aside, tennis is an easy sport to get into, but is difficult to master. Tennis coaches in the area guide students to use a tennis notebook to gather notes and keep track of their daily goals
				but it’s a challenge to get this routine to stick. TopSpin Cloud aims to meet the needs of both coaches and players alike by allowing for collaboration and tracking of progress in an easy to use iOS application.</div>

				<div class="par-case">The cloud storage and organization market is young and ripe for development. Even with big name companies filling the space
					there is room for another player to meet specific needs and enter the fray. Identifying a need in an already competitive market
					provided a challenge to overcome. The client identified there is potential to do something new in the cloud storage market but did not give much
					information beyond that. It was up to me, the UX researcher and designer to laser focus my efforts by gathering data and massaging it into a product
					design to bring to market.

				<div class="par-case">I did a competitive analysis of some of the larger competitors in the cloud storage
					market to see what was already available. The market is full of different competitors
					doing very different types of things. Each of the cloud services that were chosen for
					analysis were identified specifically because they are utilized for different purposes.
					Each of them saves content to the cloud.</div>
					<div class="center-case">

					<div class="headerTitle center"><h3><strong>User Research</strong></h3>
					</div>
					<div class="par-case">Initially I decided to work with what I know. In my current job, I work with teachers
						who have a wide range of needs. I began the process by surveying teachers and tennis
						players about their cloud storage habits and needs. Teaching, and teaching tennis are two
						subjects that I know a lot about being a former Director of Tennis and a current Technology
						Coach working with k-12 teachers. I decided to survey these two areas to work with what I know.
					</div>
					<div class="center-case">
						<img class="responsive-case" src="images/ideaToTennis.svg" alt="Idea to Tennis">
					</div>
					<div class="par-case">A majority (94%) of the surveyed use Google drive as it is what has been provided to
						them by their school district or work environment. Knowing that teachers use cloud
						storage was the foundation, but I needed to drill down deeper to see what needs they
						may have that could be met by a new solution in the market. The survey data
						identified some areas that would need to be addressed; organization methods and
						search ease.
					</div>
					<div class="center-case">
						<img class="responsive-case" src="images/cloud-storage-svc-use.svg" alt="Cloud Storage Use">
					</div>
					<div class="par-case">At this point I had quality data, but not enough to narrow down the focus of my
						application design. I designed two user personas based on the demographic data
						provided through the survey and brainstormed with my team lead.
						In our conversation we agreed that I seemed more passionate about the Tennis
						player and teacher demographic but needed data to confirm that instinct. I had
						an inlking of where this data would go but wanted to back it up with solid info
						so I developed another 5 question survey.
						In this second survey I was able to identify that there was in fact a need that
						was not being met for tennis players and coaches.</div>
						<div class="center-case">
							<img class="responsive-case" src="images/Stats.svg" alt="Stats">
						</div>
						<div class="par-case">My instinct seemed to be correct as a need was identified and an interest was
							shown in a potential note taking app geared specifically towards tennis players.
							Upon refocusing on a tennis goal and note taking app I did a quick competitive
							analysis taking a peek at Google Keep to see what the competition was doing in
							the realm of note taking and where there are areas for entrance into the market I
							also delved deeper into the user personas to identify the two major users for this
							app, tennis players and coaches.</div>

							<div class="par-case">By developing user stories I was able to identify high, medium and low importance
								needs to focus and identify where user flows would be addressed.
								For this app the high importance and medium importance processes were prioritized.
								The processes below provided a foundation for user flows which eventually transformed
								into wireframes and eventually a cohesive high fidelity design. The processes identified
								below were broken down further in the content strategy page and some initial brand
								writing was done in relation to each of the major functions within the app.

								The TopSpin Tennis Cloud app gives tennis players the ability to store notes related
								to anything on his/her tennis game in the cloud. Notes, videos, photos and court
								reviews will be stored in the cloud. The app connects local tennis players with
								coaches nearby who can give customized coaching online.

							<div class="par-case">In order to figure out if these user flow processes made sense when presented in

								with these wireframes inspiration was taken from other cloud storage applications
								in terms of their organization and some of their basic presentation. Initial onboarding
								screens were developed with information on the different functions for the app. The
								processes that I developed during wireframing included: onboarding, collaborating
								with coaches, saving notes, searching and organizing files.

							<div class="par-case">User tests were then done to see if the user experience was simple as that was the
								initial goal of designing this application (simple but focused on tennis players and
								coaches). In the essence of inclusitivity I decided to test on 2 people inside the
								target audience and one outside the target audience age range. I was able to get
								testing from a high school aged tennis player and a coach and another tennis player
								in his 60s. One super useful comment from the coach related specifically to the
								organization of the “landing page” inside the app putting most important processes
								at the top and working down from there. The high school student was able to test his
								way through the app with no issues. The older tester had some difficulty with the
								ellipses and I made note of this for later iterations of the app (high fidelity).

						<div class="text-container-case">
							<div class="headerTitle center"><h3><strong>Branding</strong></h3>
							</div>
							<div class="par-case">In developing branding for TopSpin cloud I worked with moodboards and looked at
								classic looks of different companies that have been working with tennis players
								for years to invoke a familiar feel for tennis players and coaches. I based the
								brand on the simplicity and clean look of these classics. I worked opaque tennis
								court or tennis related high quality image into the background of the onboarding screens.
								This app will be marketed to tennis players and their coaches to allow for tracking
								goals and improvements while allowing coaches a way to see and give feedback
								to players. Future iterations will include the ability to mark up videos and create side by
								side comparisons.

								Condensed were chosen because they are clean, blocky fonts that invoke old style
								tennis signage from the past. The overarching idea of the app is to be simple to use
								and to bring improvement to players of any level. The icons, colors, and typography
								work to do just that.

							<div class="par-case">High fidelity mockups of each screen of the app were developed with the above
								research in mind. Did some comparisons of current iOS apps that utilize similar
								methods to organize files (Spark, Apple Music). Style guides were referenced often
								to ensure consistency. I utilized what I had developed throughout the wireframe
								process as a skeleton. Some usability issues were identified here so the entire app
								was put through a contrast checker which caused some color changes to occur
								throughout specific screens which were adjusted. I noted here that naming really
								matters to organize the files in a meaningful way. Some of my margins were
								inconsistent. Double checked all margins throughout the design to ensure
								consistency across all screens. I utilized a numbering scheme to make sure files
								could be adjusted when feedback was given and exported easily for further use. The
								images below show progress in design due to feedback from a senior designer on the team.

							<div class="headerTitle center"><h3><strong>HiFi User Testing</strong></h3>
							</div>
							<div class="par-case">Taking into account feedback given above about contrast and icons I moved forward
								with prototyping using Adobe XD. I tested my prototype with a different group of
								users to see how close my design was to shipping.
							</div>
							<div class="par-case">
								User feedback noted a few different adjustments that needed to be made. Some of the hit boxes for touch were
								not large enough and caused confusion when trying to navigate through the
								application. The ellipses for note sharing and organization were too small and
								needed to be adjusted for usability. One of the users noted that the ellipses didn’t
								make much sense as he hadn’t used similar programs like Google Drive in the past
								so he wasn’t sure to tap there to gain access to more functions of the app.
							</div>

							<div class="par-case">I added in a tutorial screen for this which opens only when users first enter the application from
								the sign up screen. For users who enter from the sign in screen there is a different

					<section class="QuestCompleted">
						<div class="text-container-case">
							<div class="headerTitle center"><h3><strong>Quest Completed</strong></h3>
							</div>
							<div class="par-case">This research really determined the direction of the app and any processes and
								design stemmed from it. Details, details, details are what I learned from
								designing this application.
							</div>

							<div class="par-case">My initial designs were done as PNG files from
								Affinity Designer which was great to learn, but if I had it to do over again
								I would have used XD for the whole project from the start. There is something
								freeing about just making little tweaks within one piece of software.
								In my wireframe process I used both Affinity Designer and Adobe XD to develop the
								prototype.
							</div>
							<div class="par-case">This was a learning experience because there was a lot of time spent
								iterating in Affinity and then exporting and pulling into Adobe XD. Also once the
								files were inputted into Adobe to make changes required going back into Designer
								OR adding clickable rectangles over the top as “white out” and then adding a new
								element inside of XD. Some of the more visual elements needed to be designed in
								Affinity but when designing so many different screens I think Adobe makes things
								more efficient.
							</div>
							<div class="par-case"> All of the information gathered directed decisions I made throughout
								the process. The end result was a research based coherent design that can be
								implemented for design onto the iOS app store.
