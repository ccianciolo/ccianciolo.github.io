			<h2>Tennis Notes,<br> Simplified.</h2>

			<p>Growing up in Maine focusing on tennis as a sport is a challenge.<br>
				Cost aside, tennis is an easy sport to get into, but is difficult to<br> master. Tennis coaches in the area guide students to use a tennis<br> notebook to gather notes and keep track of their daily goals but it’s<br>
				a challenge to get this routine to stick. TopSpin Cloud aims to <br>meet the needs of both coaches and players alike by allowing for<br> collaboration and tracking of progress in an easy to use <br>iOS application.</p>

		<div class="centered-text">The cloud storage and organization market is young and ripe for development.<br>
			Even with big name companies filling the space there is room for another<br>
			player to meet specific needs and enter the fray. Identifying a need in an <br>
			already competitive market provided a challenge to overcome. The client <br>
			identified there is potential to do something new in the cloud storage market<br>
			but did not give much information beyond that. It was up to me, the UX<br>
			researcher and designer to laser focus my efforts by gathering data and <br>
			massaging it into a product design to bring to market.

<section class="CompetitiveAnalysis">
	<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
	<p>I did a competitive analysis of some of the larger competitors in the cloud storage<br>
		market to see what was already available. The market is full of different competitors <br>
		doing very different types of things. Each of the cloud services that were chosen for <br>
		analysis were identified specifically because they are utilized for different purposes.<br>
		Each of them saves content to the cloud.</p>
		<img src="images/google.svg">
		<p>Google Drive stores all sorts of files and is fantastic for collaboration with others.<br>
			Drive allows for collaboration in real time within content that can be created from within <br>
			the Google Drive platform. </p>
			<img src="images/pinterest.svg">
			<p>Pinterest saves links to content and is great for sharing creative “pins”. It is a great <br>
				place to gain insight into new ideas or gather creative ideas when initially embarking on <br>
				a project. </p>
				<img src="images/evernote.svg">
				<p>Evernote is a note taking application that saves content from the web that is stored <br>
					within the service. Evernote allows for collaboration as well and has the ability to take <br>
					photos, record audio and add a sketch along with attaching files to a “note”. Organization <br>
					within Evernote is limited to a notebook style system. <br><br>
					There are many questions that will need to be asked and through user surveys and analysis of <br>
					this data a niche market will begin to take shape.</p>

				<section class="UserResearch">
					<h2>User Research</h2>
					<p>Initially I decided to work with what I know. In my current job, I work with teachers<br>
						who have a wide range of needs. I began the process by surveying teachers and tennis <br>
						players about their cloud storage habits and needs. Teaching, and teaching tennis are two<br>
						subjects that I know a lot about being a former Director of Tennis and a current Technology<br>
						Coach working with k-12 teachers. I decided to survey these two areas to work with what I know.</p>
						<img src="images/ideaToTennis.svg">
						<p>A majority (94%) of the surveyed use Google drive as it is what has been provided to<br>
							them by their school district or work environment. Knowing that teachers use cloud <br>
							storage was the foundation, but I needed to drill down deeper to see what needs they<br>
							may have that could be met by a new solution in the market. The survey data <br>
							identified some areas that would need to be addressed; organization methods and <br>
							search ease. </p>
							<img src="images/cloud-storage-svc-use.svg">
							<p>At this point I had quality data, but not enough to narrow down the focus of my<br>
								application design. I designed two user personas based on the demographic data <br>
								provided through the survey and brainstormed with my team lead. <br><br>
								In our conversation we agreed that I seemed more passionate about the Tennis <br>
								player and teacher demographic but needed data to confirm that instinct. I had <br>
								an inlking of where this data would go but wanted to back it up with solid info <br>
								so I developed another 5 question survey.<br><br>
								In this second survey I was able to identify that there was in fact a need that <br>
								was not being met for tennis players and coaches.</p>
								<img src="images/Stats.svg">
								<p>My instinct seemed to be correct as a need was identified and an interest was<br>
									shown in a potential note taking app geared specifically towards tennis players.<br><br>
									Upon refocusing on a tennis goal and note taking app I did a quick competitive <br>
									analysis taking a peek at Google Keep to see what the competition was doing in <br>
									the realm of note taking and where there are areas for entrance into the market I <br>
									also delved deeper into the user personas to identify the two major users for this <br>
									app, tennis players and coaches.</p>

								<section class="UserStories">
									<h2>User Stories</h2>
									<p>By developing user stories I was able to identify high, medium and low importance <br>
										needs to focus and identify where user flows would be addressed.<br><br>
										For this app the high importance and medium importance processes were prioritized. <br>
										The processes below provided a foundation for user flows which eventually transformed <br>
										into wireframes and eventually a cohesive high fidelity design. The processes identified<br>
										 below were broken down further in the content strategy page and some initial brand <br>
										 writing was done in relation to each of the major functions within the app.

									<h2>Preference testing</h2>
									<p>For the main logo I did a preference test to identify if a black outline should be<br> included on the main logo or if white lettering worked better before beginning the<br>
										process of working on High Fidelity output.<br><br>Preference testing showed users preferred white text in the main logo.<br><br>
										Preference testing did not conclusively show any difference when testing rounded<br> corners for buttons to use within the app so I stuck with my initial choice<br> for corners.

								<section class="Quest Completed">
									<h2>Quest Completed</h2>
									<p>This research really determined the direction of the app and any processes and<br>
										design stemmed from it. Details, details, details are what I learned from<br>
										designing this application. My initial designs were done as PNG files from<br>
										Affinity Designer which was great to learn, but if I had it to do over again<br>
										I would have used XD for the whole project from the start. There is something<br>
										freeing about just making little tweaks within one piece of software.<br>
										In my wireframe process I used both Affinity Designer and Adobe XD to develop the<br>
										prototype. This was a learning experience because there was a lot of time spent<br>
										iterating in Affinity and then exporting and pulling into Adobe XD. Also once the<br>
										files were inputted into Adobe to make changes required going back into Designer<br>
										OR adding clickable rectangles over the top as “white out” and then adding a new<br>
										element inside of XD. Some of the more visual elements needed to be designed in<br>
										Affinity but when designing so many different screens I think Adobe makes things<br>
										more efficient. All of the information gathered directed decisions I made throughout<br>
										the process. The end result was a research based coherent design that can be<br>
										implemented for design onto the iOS app store.
