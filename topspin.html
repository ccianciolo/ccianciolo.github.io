			<p class="content">The cloud storage and organization market is young and ripe for development. Even with big name companies filling the space
				there is room for another player to meet specific needs and enter the fray. Identifying a need in an already competitive market
				provided a challenge to overcome. The client identified there is potential to do something new in the cloud storage market but did not give much
				information beyond that. It was up to me, the UX researcher and designer to laser focus my efforts by gathering data and massaging it into a product
				design to bring to market.

			<p class="content">I did a competitive analysis of some of the larger competitors in the cloud storage
				market to see what was already available. The market is full of different competitors
				doing very different types of things. Each of the cloud services that were chosen for
				analysis were identified specifically because they are utilized for different purposes.
				Each of them saves content to the cloud.</p>

				</div>
				<p class="content">Initially I decided to work with what I know. In my current job, I work with teachers
					who have a wide range of needs. I began the process by surveying teachers and tennis
					players about their cloud storage habits and needs. Teaching, and teaching tennis are two
					subjects that I know a lot about being a former Director of Tennis and a current Technology
					Coach working with k-12 teachers. I decided to survey these two areas to work with what I know.
				</p>
				<div class="center">
					<img class="" src="images/ideaToTennis.png" alt="Idea to Tennis">
				</div>
				<p class="content">A majority (94%) of the surveyed use Google drive as it is what has been provided to
					them by their school district or work environment. Knowing that teachers use cloud
					storage was the foundation, but I needed to drill down deeper to see what needs they
					may have that could be met by a new solution in the market. The survey data
					identified some areas that would need to be addressed; organization methods and
					search ease.
				</p>
				<div class="content">
					<div class="sectionlabel center"><h3><strong>Cloud Storage Usage</strong></div>
						<img class="" src="images/data.jpg" alt="Cloud Storage Use">
					</div>
					<p class="content">At this point I had quality data, but not enough to narrow down the focus of my
						application design. I designed two user personas based on the demographic data
						provided through the survey and brainstormed with my team lead.
						In our conversation we agreed that I seemed more passionate about the Tennis
						player and teacher demographic but needed data to confirm that instinct. I had
						an inlking of where this data would go but wanted to back it up with solid info
						so I developed another 5 question survey.
						In this second survey I was able to identify that there was in fact a need that
						was not being met for tennis players and coaches.</p>
						<div class="sectionlabel center"><h3><strong>Survey Takeaways</strong></div>

							<div class="center column-align">
								<p class="content center">84% of the surveyed did not currently have a method of tracking tennis onformation via digital or journaled method on paper.</p>
								<p class="content center">72% of the surveyed stated an interest in storing tennis related notes and videos to the cloud.</p>
								<p class="content center">63% of the surveyed were interested in comparing their tennis videos with thos of the pros.</p>
								<p class="content center">40% of the surveyed were interested in storing articles specific to tennis (already have other methods of doing so).</p>
							</div>
							<p class="content">My instinct seemed to be correct as a need was identified and an interest was
								shown in a potential note taking app geared specifically towards tennis players.
								Upon refocusing on a tennis goal and note taking app I did a quick competitive
								analysis taking a peek at Google Keep to see what the competition was doing in
								the realm of note taking and where there are areas for entrance into the market I
								also delved deeper into the user personas to identify the two major users for this
								app, tennis players and coaches.</p>

									The processes below provided a foundation for user flows which eventually transformed
									into wireframes and eventually a cohesive high fidelity design. The processes identified

								screens were developed with information on the different functions for the app. The
								processes that I developed during wireframing included: onboarding, collaborating
								with coaches, saving notes, searching and organizing files.

									coaches). In the essence of inclusitivity I decided to test on 2 people inside the
									target audience and one outside the target audience age range. I was able to get
									testing from a high school aged tennis player and a coach and another tennis player
									in his 60s.
								</p>
								<p class="content">One super useful comment from the coach related specifically to the
									organization of the “landing page” inside the app putting most important processes
									at the top and working down from there. The high school student was able to test his
									way through the app with no issues. The older tester had some difficulty with the
									ellipses and I made note of this for later iterations of the app (high fidelity).

								</div>
								<p class="content">In developing branding for TopSpin cloud I worked with moodboards and looked at
									classic looks of different companies that have been working with tennis players
									for years to invoke a familiar feel for tennis players and coaches. I based the
									brand on the simplicity and clean look of these classics. I worked opaque tennis
									court or tennis related high quality image into the background of the onboarding screens.
									This app will be marketed to tennis players and their coaches to allow for tracking
									goals and improvements while allowing coaches a way to see and give feedback
									to players. Future iterations will include the ability to mark up videos and create side by
									side comparisons.

									Condensed were chosen because they are clean, blocky fonts that invoke old style
									tennis signage from the past. The overarching idea of the app is to be simple to use
									and to bring improvement to players of any level. The icons, colors, and typography
									work to do just that.

											to ensure consistency. I utilized what I had developed throughout the wireframe
											process as a skeleton. Some usability issues were identified here so the entire app
											was put through a contrast checker which caused some color changes to occur
											throughout specific screens which were adjusted.
										</p>
										<p class="content">I noted here that naming really
											matters to organize the files in a meaningful way. Some of my margins were
											inconsistent. Double checked all margins throughout the design to ensure
											consistency across all screens. I utilized a numbering scheme to make sure files
											could be adjusted when feedback was given and exported easily for further use. The

											with prototyping using Adobe XD. I tested my prototype with a different group of
											users to see how close my design was to shipping.
										</p>
										<p class="content">
											User feedback noted a few different adjustments that needed to be made. Some of the hit boxes for touch were
											not large enough and caused confusion when trying to navigate through the
											application. The ellipses for note sharing and organization were too small and
											needed to be adjusted for usability. One of the users noted that the ellipses didn’t
											make much sense as he hadn’t used similar programs like Google Drive in the past
											so he wasn’t sure to tap there to gain access to more functions of the app.
										</p>

										<p class="content">I added in a tutorial screen for this which opens only when users first enter the application from

										</div>
										<br>
										<p class="content">This research really determined the direction of the app and any processes and
											design stemmed from it. Details, details, details are what I learned from
											designing this application.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p class="content">My initial designs were done as PNG files from
											Affinity Designer which was great to learn, but if I had it to do over again
											I would have used XD for the whole project from the start. There is something
											freeing about just making little tweaks within one piece of software.
											In my wireframe process I used both Affinity Designer and Adobe XD to develop the
											prototype.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p class="content">This was a learning experience because there was a lot of time spent
											iterating in Affinity and then exporting and pulling into Adobe XD. Also once the
											files were inputted into Adobe to make changes required going back into Designer
											OR adding clickable rectangles over the top as “white out” and then adding a new
											element inside of XD. Some of the more visual elements needed to be designed in
											Affinity but when designing so many different screens I think Adobe makes things
											more efficient.
										</p>
										<br>
										<p class="content"> All of the information gathered directed decisions I made throughout
											the process. The end result was a research based coherent design that can be
											implemented for design onto the iOS app store.
