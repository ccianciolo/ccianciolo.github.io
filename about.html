    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="header3">Love at First Sound</div>
    <div class="par">On Christmas 1992, my life changed. My brother woke me up early in the morning, as he always did on Christmas, and we waited for my parents
      to call us downstairs to see what Santa had brought.The dulcet tones of a synthesized version of Jingle Bells started to play downstairs. We rushed downstairs
      and, to our shock and delight, our parents had purchased a Gateway 2000 PC for Christmas. This was the first event in a life-long love affair with technology.</div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="header3">Designing the Boot</div>
      <div class="par">Growing up, Star Wars was a constant in our house. Return of the Jedi was a staple that we watched whenever we got the chance so our VHS tape would
        sometimes display a blurry screen due to its overuse. When Star Wars X-Wing Fighter was released for MS-Dos, I jumped at the chance to fly my own X-Wing just like Luke
        did in Jedi. In 1993, getting a computer to run a game out of the box proved to be a challenge, as games in ‘93 ran off of multiple floppy disks and not CD-roms.
        Having previously only played Nintendo games I was surprised to see that putting the floppy into the drive did not immediately boot up the game! I discovered that
        I needed to write my own boot disk to make this program work. I pulled out the giant manual that came with our computer for MS-Dos and sifted through the pages to
        find the information I needed in order to write my first boot disk, marking my introduction to complex problem solving using coding.

      <h3><div class="header3">The Process of the Process</div></h3>
      <div class="par">In 2011, after putting in the obligatory undergraduate tour of duty in retail, I went back to college to work on my Master’s in education. There
        I learned about the differentiation model. Differentiation-- tailoring instruction to meet individual needs-- was my first glance into the world of User Experience
        design. How could I meet the needs of all of my students? To do this effectively I needed to gather data, analyze this data, and then put it to direct use in my
        teaching. Data-informed decision making became a part of everyday life for 8 years of teaching, just as it had all those years earlier while getting X-Wing to run,
        and the process became a passion of mine.

      <h3><div class="header3">Let's Solve a Problem Together</div></h3>
      <div class="par">My journey with education has brought many challenges and many wins along with it. One of my proudest accomplishments was working with my administrator
        to design and implement 3D printing design programs district-wide. The Design Process became all-encompassing as I worked to instill the grit and determination to solve
        problems through well-researched design thinking with students. I guided them through the design process to help them create something tangible and possibly solve a wealth
        of problems along the way. We designed and 3D modeled bridges, chameleons, creepy carrots, and eventually we even designed our own models of eco-friendly houses for the homeless.

      <h3><div class="header3">The Here and Now</div></h3>
      <div class="par">The design process has always been a guiding force in my life and served as the kindling for the fire that led me to the path of becoming a UX designer.
        This passion for creating, coupled with my desire to engage my inner engineer,  has become the foundation of base camp at design mountain. Throughout the journey multiple
        camps will be assembled as I encounter new mountains to ascend.  Each destination throughout my adventure is an opportunity to redefine good design, starting from the
        foundation up. Let’s make camp in good design, shall we?
