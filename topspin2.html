		<div class="container-60 top-content">Growing up in Maine focusing on tennis as a sport is a challenge.
			Cost aside, tennis is an easy sport to get into, but is difficult to master. Tennis coaches in the area guide students to use a tennis
			notebook to gather notes and keep track of their daily goals but it’s a challenge to get this routine to stick. TopSpin Cloud meets the
			needs of both coaches and players alike by allowing for collaboration and tracking of progress in an easy to use iOS application.

				<h2 class="sectionlabel">Problem</h2>
				<div class="content">Tennis coaches in the area face inconsistent weather conditions and meeting
					times during the Spring season which leads to a decrease in overall improvement. Coaches guide
					students to use a tennis notebook to gather notes and keep track of their daily goals but it’s
					a challenge to get this routine to stick.

				<h2 class="sectionlabel">Solution</h2>
				<div class="content">TopSpin aims to meet the needs of both coaches and players alike by
					allowing for collaboration and tracking of progress in an easy to use iOS application. TopSpin
					is mobile so it can go anywhere, capture info on training, and allow for the ever Important
					communication between player and coach.

			<h3 class="sectionlabel">What I learned</h3>
			<p class="content">I had doubts at the beginning about whether or not another cloud storage service would fit into the already saturated
				market. The initial user survey did not verify that the need, was in fact, there. But my instinct said to press on. A second, more
				focused survey (which focused on tennis players and coaches) shed some more light on the direction of the application and its overall
				design. Given more time, I would have done some in-person interviews with potential users to identify what types of features would make V1 of the application successful. This research really determined the direction of the app and any processes and design stemmed from it. Details, details, details are what I learned from designing this application. I learned a lot about design systems while designing this app. I would utilize this knowledge to make the future design more streamlined and simplified. All of the initial information gathered directed decisions I made throughout the process. The end result is a
				research-based design that can be implemented for design onto the iOS app store.
