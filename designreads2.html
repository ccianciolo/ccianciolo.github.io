	<div class="content">New designers are constantly looking for content and a way to organize their new learning

			<h2 class="sectionlabel">Problem</h2>
			<div class="content">We discovered that aspiring UX Designers struggle to discover beneficial learning materials
				and enjoy communicating with like-minded individuals who share the same educational goal.
				We believe that connecting them by providing a space for sharing beneficial material benefits
				aspiring designers while they gain confidence within their field.
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2 class="sectionlabel">Solution</h2>
			<div class="content">DesignReads aims to create an environment for UX Designers to share beneficial reading material.
				In the space, designers can rate, review, and discuss popular resources including books, blogs,
				videos, and articles. This space will allow designers to search topics applicable to their interest
				while gauging content strength from reviews and ratings.

		<h3 class="sectionlabel">What I learned</h3>
		<p class="content">Working on DesignReads gave me a great deal of insight into working on a remote team.  I realized how challenging
			managing a team can be. Organizing people, keeping everyone on a timeline, and fitting meetings into busy schedules. I found that
			using a kanban board allowed us to implement a modified sprint method, so we each could select the tasks we had time to complete for a
			given week. I also found that using a time tracker to record how much time we spent on a single task allowed us to be more productive
			and held us accountable to our weekly commitments. Staying organized is a huge aspect of the UX design process and working with a group
			makes it important. I learned that having each team member document their process, decisions, and findings in a shared space is extremely
			valuable. Having a shared space to document the project not only helps with writing the case study once the project is complete, but can
			also save hours that are spent in meetings.

																			<!--Conclusion-->
																			<section class="container-60">
																				<h3 class="sectionlabel">Conclusion</h3>
																				<p class="content">This was my first project working with a group of other designers and I faced many unique challenges. In the past, my design decisions
																					were never challenged by others yet when working with a team of designers, everyone had an opinion. Our biggest challenge was when we were working on
																					the high fidelity mockups. We had varying ideas of how the style should be implemented. We realized that while the styling of the original high fidelity mockups
																					worked for Android, they did not adhere to iOS Standards. Therefore, we decided to create a version for both that could express our individual style preferences. While this
																					solution worked for our passion project, in a professional setting, we would have A/B tested the two prototypes and let data decide which was best.</p>
																					<br>

																					<p class="content">Also, being that I worked as a project manager for this project, I realized how hard managing a team can be. It is challenging to organize people, keep
																						everyone on a timeline, and work meetings into busy schedules. I found that using a kanban board allowed us to implement a modified sprint method,
																						so we each could select the tasks we had time to complete for a given week. I also found that using a time tracker to record how
																						much time we spent on a single task allowed us to be more productive and held us accountable to our weekly commitments.</p>
																						<br>

																						<p class="content">Staying organized is a huge aspect of the UX design process and working with a group makes it important. I learned that having each team
																							member document their process, decisions, and findings in a shared space is extremely valuable. Having a shared space to document the project not only helps
																							with writing the case study once the project is complete, but can also save hours that are spent in meetings.</p>
